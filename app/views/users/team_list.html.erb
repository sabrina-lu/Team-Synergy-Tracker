        This is the place to be if you want to know more about your team's health!

    <h3>Current Week's Team Health:</h3>
    <p style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:5%;">
        At the top of the page you will find a quick visualization that reflects your current week's team health.
        <br><br>
        The weekly team health is a direct reflection of how your team feels about the current week as well your their teammates!
        <br>
        It's simple! The higher the number, the happier your team is!🥳
        <br><br>
        Here at Paen, we recommend that you do your best to motivate you to always complete your surveys, as the more team members complete their surveys, the more accurate our estimation will be!
    </p>
    <h3>What if I don't complete my weekly survey?</h3>
    <p style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:5%;">
        Nothing. From our point-of-view that is just one less data point for us to use. 😭 However, your manager likely really wants you to complete your weekly surveys. By completing your weekly surveys you may directly impact how your team is run and the decisions made by your manager.
        <br><br>
        After all, teamwork makes the dream work, right?🧐
